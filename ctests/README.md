# SplinterDB Unit-Testing

We have adopted CTest, which is a unit testing framework for software written in C/C++,
to develop unit tests for SplinterDB. 

The [CTest framework](https://github.com/bvdberg/ctest) has been slightly modified and
adapted to work with the SplinterDB code base.

See this [README.md](https://github.com/bvdberg/ctest/blob/master/README.md) file for a
fuller description of the features of this CTest framework.
